# Billing-Systems_GUI
A simple billing system to which we enter the amount of rugs, fabrics,
blinds that we want to order and possible delivery to your home.
After clicking the total button,
the program shows us the price of a particular product in the quantity
we have chosen and the total value of the order,
the amount of tax and the amount without tax. 
We have a calculator at our disposal. 
When we click the sales reference button, 
we receive an individual order number. 
After that, when we run the program, 
the current date is generated. 
In addition, we have a reset button that resets all data from the class 
and an exit button that allows you to exit the program
